This is a small application to learn new words
 by repitition.

You will see the words repetitively and select 
the defintion and use them in a sentence.

We will make database connections and pulls via 
PHP, read only at the point.

Everything else will be handled on the browser
 via javascript.

//  TODO:

	make clicking the overlay also destroy the elements..

	remove bootstrap
	
	Add more words to the database

	Update Styles / design

	Maybe, eventually use the websters or dictionary.com apis...
