This is a small application to learn new words
 by repitition.

You will see the words repetitively and select 
the defintion and use them in a sentence.

We will make database connections and pulls via 
PHP, read only at the point.

Everything else will be handled on the browser
 via javascript.

//  TODO:

	Create Database and table for words.

	Create PHP Object to retrive data

	Utilize this object on initial page load and the ajax file

	Maybe, eventually use the websters or dictionary.com apis...
