This is a small application to learn new words
 by repitition.

You will see the words repetitively and select 
the defintion and use them in a sentence.

We will make database connections and pulls via 
PHP, read only at the point.

Everything else will be handled on the browser
 via javascript.

//  TODO:

	Need to create a fade in, with adjustable opacity variable.
	
	Change these styles because the fade out is making me feel blind...

	Maybe, eventually use the websters or dictionary.com apis...
