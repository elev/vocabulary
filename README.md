This is a small application to learn new words
 by repetition.

You will see the words repetitively and select 
the defintion.

We will make database connections and pulls via 
PHP, javascript will controll everything else.

I am not using jQuery as an attempt to become more
familiar with regular javascript.

//  TODO:

	git remove the bootstrap that is not being used

	Fix defintion spelling errors in db

	Add more words to the database

	Maybe, eventually use the websters or dictionary.com apis...

	Update and add a useage of the words, and perhaps a word list state 
	to show different words every week.
